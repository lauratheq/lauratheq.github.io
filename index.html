	<h2>L(a)unchtime for Laura</h2>

	<p>I've been absent from the WordPress communtiy for roundabout five years. After some mental health problems, several company switches and a pause from community work I felt the urge to come back to the WordPress community. So I visited the first <a href="https://germany.wordcamp.org/2023/">WordCamp in germany</a> since the pandemic and it was a blast. For me it felt like a homecoming and I realized how much I missed the community.</p>
	<p>The euphoria of the WordCamp visit made me thinking on how to approach something like coming back to a community which essentially burned me out. One of the biggest mistakes was to put the community and the supposed (supposed by me) expectations of it as my highest priority. I also couldn't say no. Both changed. While growing in the past years I learned what my my personal needs are and put them first.</p>
	<p>Therefore I want to start slow and grow back into the community. I have a couple of ideas for contributing to the technical side of WordPress. I'd like to tackle this by slowly contributing with code as well as holding some workshops at local WordCamps. For example, there has been ten sponsors from WordPress hosting companies at the last WordCamp Germany but basically one single sessions and no contribution to that topic. I want to change that.</p>
	<p>But there is also need for awareness for certain topics like accessibility, existing sexism and the bias around it, queer representation or enviromental issues within the community. This topic is especially hard because it takes up a lot of mental load and I need to find a way to balance my own needs with the things I want to achieve.</p>
	<p>It'll be interesting and I think I am prepared to be back.</p>
